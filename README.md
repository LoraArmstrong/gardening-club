Data on pests, weeds, and fruit/veg yields in my &amp; surrounding allotments in 2018.

Data collected via a Google Form survey that gardening club members filled out.

This is the first year we collected data and it will act as a baseline for future years. 

We hope to gain a better understanding of:

* How pests like mole crickets are spreading through the allotments
* If garden treatments (for example- adding manure or treating garden with nematodes) show any correlation with mole cricket damage or weed levels
* What people are growing and what their yields are
